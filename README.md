# Student-Depression-Analysis
This project analyzes the mental health and depression patterns among students using data visualization in Tableau.
The dataset contains information about 502 students, covering their academic stress levels, study satisfaction, sleep duration, dietary habits, financial stress, and other factors that influence their mental health.
By connecting the dataset through Microsoft SQL Server and visualizing it in Tableau, the project aims to explore correlations between lifestyle, academic, and psychological factors and their impact on depression.
